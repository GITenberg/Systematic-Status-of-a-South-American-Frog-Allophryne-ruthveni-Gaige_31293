Systematic Status of a South American Frog,<br />
Allophryne ruthveni Gaige</h2>

<p class="center">BY<br /><br />

JOHN D. LYNCH AND HOWARD L. FREEMAN</p>


<p>Gaige (1926) described <i>Allophryne ruthveni</i> as a new genus and
species of diminutive bufonid from British Guiana. Noble (1931)
considered <i>A. ruthveni</i> to be a toothless relative of <i>Centrolenella</i>
and placed the genus in the Hylidae. Gallardo (1965) suggested
that <i>Allophryne</i> is a leptodactylid of uncertain affinities. Other
references to the monotypic genus have consisted only of a listing
of the name or of its inclusion in a key. To date the holotype and
one paratype (both females) have been reported (Gaige, 1926),
and the family position of the genus remains unsettled.</p>

<p>A male of <i>Allophryne ruthveni</i> is among the amphibians and
reptiles collected in southern British Guiana by William A. Bentley
in January, 1962, and deposited in the Museum of Natural History
at The University of Kansas (KU). Four additional specimens
(females) are in the American Museum of Natural History; only
one of the latter has definite locality data.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Acknowledgments.</i>&mdash;We are grateful to Dr. Ernest E. Williams, Museum of
Comparative Zoology (MCZ) and Dr. Richard G. Zweifel, American Museum
of Natural History (AMNH) for the loan of specimens. We are further indebted
to Dr. Zweifel for permission to clear and stain one specimen. Dr.
William E. Duellman and Linda Trueb offered many constructive criticisms.
Miss Trueb executed the drawings of the skull and finger bones. Mr. Martin
Wiley provided x-ray photographs of <i>Allophryne</i>.</p></div>


<h3>METHODS AND MATERIALS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Six of the seven known specimens were available for study. Measurements
were taken in the manner described by Duellman (1956). One specimen was
cleared and stained, using the technique of Davis and Gore (1936), in order
to study the skeleton. X-ray photographs were made of another specimen for
comparison.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Six, as follows: BRITISH GUIANA, <i>Dist. Demarara</i>:
Marudi Creek, AMNH 44749; <i>Dist. Equibo</i>: Tumatumari, MCZ 11790 (paratype);
<i>Dist. Rupununi</i> (<i>Berbice</i>): Wai Wai Country, N of Acarahy Mountains,
west of New River (2&deg;N, 58&deg;W), KU 69890. Also, 3 specimens from "probably
British Guiana," AMNH 70108-10 (70110 cleared and stained).</p></div>


<h3>SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT</h3>

<p>The availability of additional material and the new information
pertaining to osteology permit an amplification of Gaige's (1926)
description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Dorsum gray with irregular network of black lines and elongate
blotches; flanks and labial region black with large white ocelli; dorsal surfaces
of limbs gray, marked as follows: two large, elongate white spots on each
thigh, concealed white spot on base of upper arm, black-edged gray transverse
bars on forearms and shanks, white spot on each knee and elbow; ventral surfaces
pale gray; black-edged white spot on ventral surface of thigh on each
side of anal opening; chin and throat dark gray with white spots; vocal sac
in male black (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>a and c).</p>

<p>Gaige (1926) briefly described the color, which conforms to the above in
all particulars. The paratype (MCZ 11790) has lost the gray color after 40
years in preservation; now (1966) the ground-color is cream-brown, and the
dorsal spotting, noted by Gaige as being black, is now brown.</p>

<p>The spots on the feet, tarsi, knees, thighs, flanks and upper arm are white
in preservative, but in life possibly were red or yellow. These colors usually
fade to white in preservative. Red or yellow spots are common aposematic
colors in frogs.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;Eight measurements were taken on each specimen and four
ratios were computed; these are summarized in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. Gaige's illustration
of the holotype shows that it has a greatly reduced pattern, whereas the paratype
and three of the other five known specimens have relatively large and
numerous spots. The male (KU 69890) and one female (AMNH 70108) have
a reduced pattern intermediate between that of the holotype and the four other
specimens.</p></div>

<h3>FAMILY POSITION</h3>

<p>The following characters of <i>Allophryne</i> are those generally held to be useful
in determining family relationships:</p>


<ol><li>Presacral vertebrae procoelus, eight in number.</li>

<li>Parahyoid absent.</li>

<li>Free ribs lacking.</li>

<li>Bidder's organ absent.</li>

<li>Intercalary cartilages present in digits; phalangeal formulae 3-3-4-4 and 3-3-4-5-4.</li>

<li>Coccyx articulating with sacrum by two condyles.</li>

<li>Tarsal bones not fused.</li>

<li>Pectoral girdle arciferal.</li>

<li>Epicoracoidal horns present, free.</li>

<li>Terminal phalanges T-shaped.</li>

<li>Sacrum procoelus and diapophyses expanded.</li>

<li>Maxillae, premaxillae, and prevomers edentate.</li>

<li>Cranial roofing bones well ossified.</li>
</ol>

<p>Griffiths (1959) accorded considerable taxonomic weight to the presence or
absence of epicoracoidal horns in showing relationships among the genera
placed in the Brachycephalidae [= Atelopodidae; Dendrobatidae; and Leptodactylidae
(in part)] by Noble (1931). <i>Allophryne</i> possesses well-developed,
free epicoracoidal horns, such as those found in the Hylidae, Centrolenidae,
Leptodactylidae and Bufonidae.</p>

<p>The presence of intercalary elements in the digits is characteristic of the
Centrolenidae, Hylidae, Phrynomeridae, Pseudidae, and the rhacophorine
ranids (including the Hyperoliidae). This element is bony in the pseudids
and cartilaginous in the other families. Phrynomerids and rhacophorine ranids
lack epicoracoidal horns and have firmisternal pectoral girdles. Centrolenids
are small, delicate, arboreal frogs having poorly ossified skulls and fused tarsal
bones, but agree with <i>Allophryne</i> in having T-shaped terminal phalanges.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><img src="images/image002.png" width="600" height="326" alt="Fig. 2. Dorsal (a) and lateral (b)
views of distal phalanges of third
finger of Allophryne. &times; 40." title="Fig. 2. Dorsal (a) and lateral (b)
views of distal phalanges of third
finger of Allophryne. &times; 40." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 2. Dorsal (a) and lateral (b)
views of distal phalanges of third
finger of Allophryne. &times;&nbsp;40.</span>
</p>

<p>Only the presence of intercalary cartilages (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) suggests relationship of
<i>Allophryne</i> to the Hylidae. The T-shaped terminal phalanges suggest affinities
with centrolenids, elutherodactyline leptodactylids, or certain "brachycephalid"
frogs. Griffiths (1959) clearly showed that Noble's Brachycephalidae was a
polyphyletic assemblage. No hylid genus is edentate, and none has either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
T-shaped terminal phalanges or the unusual dorsal spinules. Perhaps the
presence of intercalary cartilages is not indicative of relationship but instead
is a parallelism (or convergence) in <i>Allophryne</i> and genera of the Centrolenidae.</p>


<h3>CRANIAL OSTEOLOGY</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The skull of <i>Allophryne</i> (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) is distinctive among anurans; it does not
closely resemble the skulls of either hylids or centrolenids, both of which have
generally more delicate (except for casque-headed hylids, such as <i>Corythomantis</i>,
<i>Diaglena</i>, <i>Osteocephalus</i>, <i>Triprion</i>) and generalized skulls. <i>Allophryne</i>
on the other hand has a strongly ossified central region (cranial roofing
bones and sphenethmoid complex) and a weak peripheral zone. The peripheral
elements are reduced (maxilla, pterygoid, and squamosal) or absent (quadratojugal),
whereas the frontoparietals, nasals, sphenethmoid, pro&ouml;tics, and exoccipitals
form a compact central zone. An elongate frontoparietal fontanelle is
present.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><img src="images/image003.png" width="600" height="567" alt="Fig. 3. Dorsal view of skull of Allophryne (AMNH 70110). &times; 12." title="Fig. 3. Dorsal view of skull of Allophryne (AMNH 70110). &times; 12." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 3. Dorsal view of skull of Allophryne (AMNH 70110). &times;&nbsp;12.</span>
</p>

<p>Dorsally (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>), the premaxillae are not visible. The proportionally
gigantic septomaxillae are visible anterior to the nasals. The moderate-sized
nasals are separated medially and in broad contact with the ethmoid posteriorly.
The palatine process of the nasal does not meet the frontal process of the
maxilla. A large frontoparietal fontanelle is evident between the frontoparietals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
The tegmen tympani are much reduced and maintain only cartilaginous contact
with the posterior arms of the squamosals. The foramen magnum, occipital
condyles, and exoccipitals show no unusual features. The <i>pars facialis</i>
and frontal process of the maxilla are greatly reduced. The maxilla and
premaxilla are articulated. The high, narrow alary processes of the premaxillae
extend dorsally about two-thirds of the height of the snout. A cartilaginous
internasal septum is illustrated (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>), but sectioning is necessary to determine
the true nature and extent of this element.</p>

<p>Ventrally, the skull lacks palatines. The maxillae, premaxillae, and prevomers
are edentate. The parasphenoid is large with relatively short, stout
alary (lateral) processes. The sphenethmoid is extensive in ventral aspect and
forms the major supporting structure in the anterior part of the skull. The
pterygoid has a broad articulation with the maxilla, a tenuous contact with
the squamosal, but is not attached to the pro&ouml;tic. The anterior (zygomatic)
process of the squamosal is greatly reduced (only about one-third the length
of the posterior process).</p></div>


<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

<p>The skull of <i>Allophryne</i> is definitely non-hylid. Most of the post-cranial
features do not help to clarify relationships. <i>Allophryne</i>
shares several osteological features with the Dendrobatidae:
T-shaped terminal phalanges, general cranial morphology and
procoelus vertebrae. But, the dendrobatids possess firmisternal
pectoral girdles and lack epicoracoidal horns. Also, no dendrobatid
has intercalary elements in the digits. We are, therefore, left
with a taxonomic enigma. In one or more characters generally regarded
as important, <i>Allophryne</i> differs from all presently defined
families of frogs. The Hylidae and Dendrobatidae are the only currently
recognized families in which the genus might be placed.</p>

<p>The function and taxonomic importance of the large septomaxillae
are unknown and are probably associated with the modification of
the sphenethmoid-prevomer area. A more detailed study of the
cranial osteology of <i>Allophryne</i>, especially the structural relationships
of the sphenethmoid-prevomer area may elucidate the relationships
of <i>Allophryne</i>.</p>

<p>The relationships of <i>Allophryne</i> cannot be understood without a
re-analysis of some of the features used as major criteria in frog
classification (the nature of an intercalated cartilage; the nature of
the sternal complex; the relative value of cranial osteology; the
vertebral structure; and the thigh musculature). Some of these
features have been investigated by other workers, most notably
Griffiths, but others have not and need re-examination. A re-analysis
of some of the major criteria used in frog classification is in progress
(Callison, Lynch, and Trueb) and upon completion of that study
we think the relationships of <i>Allophryne</i> will become apparent.</p>

<p>A more comprehensive study of the cranial anatomy of certain
hylids, leptodactylids, dendrobatids, and atelopodids along with
that of <i>Allophryne</i> is needed to clarify the relationships of <i>Allophryne</i>,
and might indicate that the recognition of a fifth family is
necessary.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Among currently recognized families of frogs, <i>Allophryne</i> is least
different from the Hylidae although it is our opinion that inclusion
of this genus in the Hylidae probably represents an unnatural classification.
However, the present evidence suggesting that <i>Allophryne</i>
should be in another family is less convincing than evidence suggesting
it should be in the Hylidae. We tentatively place <i>Allophryne</i>
in the Hylidae.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
